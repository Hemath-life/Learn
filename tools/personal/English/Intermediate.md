### Modal verbs

can - could

may - might

must

shall - should

will - would

We use modals to show if we believe something is **certain, possible or impossible**:

```
My keys must be in the car.
It might rain tomorrow.
That can't be Peter's coat. It's too small.
```

We also use them to do things like talk about **ability, ask permission, and make requests and offers**:

```
I can't swim.
May I ask a question?
Could I have some tea, please?
Would you like some help?
```

### Relative pronouns

The most common relative pronouns are **who, whom, whose, which, that**. The relative pronoun we use depends on what we are referring to and the type of relative clause.

1. We donâ€™t know the person _who_ donated this money.

2. We drove past my old school, _which_ is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.

3. He went to the school _(that)_ my father went to.

4. The Kingfisher group, _whose_ name was changed from Woolworths earlier this year, includes about 720 high street shops. Superdrug, which last week announced that it is buying Medicare, is also part of the group.

5. The parents (whom/who/that) we interviewed were all involved in education in some way.

examples:

1. He is a doctor. Who treated me.
2. She is the girl'. Who got first Mark.
3. No one's knows. When is going to get over.
4. I don't know. Where i kept my key.
5. I don't know.where to start.
6. I don't know. What she is going to do.
7. This is how we spent Holiday.
8. We didn't know why she shouted like that.
9. This is the dress. Which I bought yesterday.

### Could have, should have, would have

These past modal verbs are all used hypothetically, to talk about things that **didn't really happen in the past**.

1. **Could have + past participle** means that something was possible in the past, or you had the ability to do something in the past, but that you didn't do it. (See also modals of ability.)

- I **could have** stayed up late, but I decided to go to bed early.
- They **could have** won the race, but they didn't try hard enough.

  **Couldn't have + past participle** means that something wasn't possible in the past, even if you had wanted to do it.

- He couldn't have passed the exam, even if he had studied harder. It's a really, really difficult exam.

2. Should have + past participle

- I should have gone to bed early

3. Would have + past participle

- Part of the third conditional.
  If I had had enough money, I would have bought a car (but I didn't have enough money, so I didn't buy a car).

- Because 'would' (and will) can also be used to show if you want to do something or not (volition), we can also use would have + past participle to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't. This is very similar to the third conditional, but we don't need an 'if clause'.
- I would have gone to the party, but I was really busy.
  (= I wanted to go to the party, but I didn't because I was busy. If I hadn't been so busy, I would have gone to the party.)
- I would have called you, but I didn't know your number.
  (= I wanted to call you but I didn't know your number, so I didn't call you.)
  A: Nobody volunteered to help us with the fair
  B: I would have helped you. I didn't know you needed help.
  (= If I had known that you needed help, I would have helped you.)
  example:

```
1. I should have told you. - solli erukalam
2. I could have told you. - solli eruka vendum
3. I would have told you. - soli erupen if i know

1. I shouldn't have told you.
2. I couldn't have told you.
3. I wouldn't have told you.

```

## 1. Class

- **Procedural Based Programming:**

  - It involves a relationship with another code (function), creating dependencies.
  - Functions depend on each other, leading to increased complexity as relationships grow.
  - In OOP, we have objects and classes.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - **Class:**
    - Acts like a blueprint for what we are creating.
    - Attributes: Variables.
    - Behavior: Methods.
    - A class is analogous to a human object, such as Raj, Hemath, Justin, Kumar, etc.
  - **Constructor:**
    - Gets automatically called when creating an object, initializing the object.
  - **self and this:**
    - In Python, we use `self`; in JavaScript, it's `this`.
    - Both are used to access the variable associated with the current instance.

## 2. Python Packages

- **PyPI (Python Package Index):**
  - Similar to NPM, it's a repository of Python software.

## 3. Case in Programming Languages

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - PascalCase: First letter capitalized.
  - camelCase.
  - snake_case.
  - kebab-case.

## 4. Class Inheritance

- **Inheritance:**
  - Inherits all features from the parent class.

## 5. super

- `super` refers to the superclass (parent class).

## 6. API

- **Open Trivia Database:**
  - Used for quiz games.

## 7. Links

1. **Turtle Package:**
   - Used for graphics.
2. **Pretty Table:**
   - Formats data into rows and columns.
3. **Colorgram:**
   - Extracts image colors.

## 8. Event Listeners, Higher Order Function, State, and Multiple Instances

- **Concepts:**
  - Turtle event listeners.
  - Higher-order functions.
  - State.
  - Multiple instances.

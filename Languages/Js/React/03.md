# useState

The `useState` hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to manage and update their own state.

It provides a way to declare state variables and a function to update them within a functional component.

### Syntax:

```jsx
const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);
```

`stateVariable`: This is the variable that holds the current state value.

`setStateFunction`: This is a function that you can use to update the state.

`initialValue`: The initial value you want to assign to the state variable.

### Example

Suppose you want to create a simple counter component using `useState`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Define a state variable 'count' with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Event handler to increment the count
  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

# useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is a fundamental part of React's functional component API.

It allows you to perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscription management.

This hook is often used to handle tasks that involve interactions with the outside world or managing component lifecycle events.

### Syntax:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

useEffect(() => {
  // Your code for side effects goes here
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

The first argument to `useEffect` is a function containing the code for your side effect.

The second argument is an optional array of dependencies. If provided, the effect will only run if any of the dependencies have changed since the last render.

### Common Use Cases

**Data Fetching:** You can use useEffect to fetch data from APIs or other data sources when the component mounts.

**DOM Manipulation:** You can perform DOM manipulations, like adding event listeners or updating the DOM, within useEffect.

**Subscriptions:** When dealing with real-time data from WebSocket connections or other event sources, you can use useEffect to set up and tear down subscriptions.

**Clean-up:** useEffect also allows you to return a cleanup function, which will be executed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change. This is useful for tasks like unsubscribing from event listeners or cancelling network requests.

### Example

Here's a simple example of using `useEffect` to fetch data when a component mounts:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return <div>{data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}</div>;
}
```

## Timing of `useEffect` Execution in React

The `useEffect` hook in React runs at specific times during a component's lifecycle. The timing of its execution depends on whether you specify a dependency array and what values are included in that array:

### 1. Without Dependencies (Empty Dependency Array)

If you pass an empty dependency array (`[]`) as the second argument to `useEffect`, it will run the effect only once after the initial render of the component. This is similar to the behavior of `componentDidMount` in class components. It won't run again for subsequent re-renders.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs once after the initial render
}, []);
```

### 2. With Dependencies

When you provide a non-empty array of dependencies, the effect will run whenever any of the dependencies change. This is similar to the behavior of componentDidUpdate in class components.

```jsx
const someValue = /* some value */;

useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs whenever 'someValue' changes
}, [someValue]);
// If multiple dependencies are specified, the effect will run if any of them change.
```

### 3. Without Dependencies (No Dependency Array)

If you omit the second argument altogether, the effect will run after every render.

This can lead to performance issues and should be used with caution. It is similar to the behavior of componentDidUpdate without specifying conditions.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs after every render
});
```

### 4. Cleanup Function

In all cases, if your `useEffect` function returns a function, it will act as a `cleanup` function.

This cleanup function is executed when the component `unmounts` or when the dependencies change (before the effect runs again). It's used to clean up any resources, subscriptions, or event listeners created by the effect.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs (and cleanup runs) when the component mounts and unmounts
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code goes here
  };
}, []);
```

## Why is it Called `useEffect`?

The `useEffect` hook in React is named "useEffect" because it is designed to manage and execute side effects in functional components.

`Side effects` are operations that occur outside of the normal component rendering process and can include tasks like data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions to external data sources.

The name "useEffect" signifies its usage as a hook specifically created for managing side effects within React components. It follows the naming convention of other React hooks, such as `useState` and `useContext`, which also clearly describe their intended purposes.

In summary, "useEffect" is called as such because it is used to efficiently manage and handle side effects in a declarative manner within functional components in React.

# useContext

First, you need to import the useContext hook from React. Here's how you do it:

```JSX
import React, { useContext,createContext } from 'react';
```

## Step 1: Create a context

Next, you need to create a context using the `createContext` function. This context will hold the shared data that you want to access in your components. Here's an example:

```JSX
const MyContext = React.createContext();

// example of user auth
export const UserContext = createContext({
  setCurrentUser: () => null,
  currentUser: null,
});
```

- `setCurrentUser: () => null` and `currentUser: null` are initial values for context properties.
- They act as `placeholders until` real values are provided.
- `setCurrentUser` is a function that typically updates the current user.
- currentUser initially represents no authenticated user (null).
- `Providing default values` ensures components can access them even before they're set.
- It establishes a clear contract for what data and functions the context offers.
- Components can rely on these `defaults until real data/functions are available`.
- It's like setting up a clear agreement for what data and tools the context provides define the structure.

## Step 2: Create a Provider Component

- Create a provider component that will wrap the part of your application where you want to `share data`. This component should be responsible for providing the `context` to its children.

```JSX
function MyProvider({ children }) {
  // Define the data you want to share
  const sharedData = { key: 'value' };

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={sharedData}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

// example of user auth
// Create a provider component that uses the context
function UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // Define a state variable for the current user
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);

  // Create a value object with the current user and a function to set it
  const value = { currentUser, setCurrentUser };

  // Provide the value to components wrapped by this provider
  return <UserContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</UserContext.Provider>;
};

```

## Step 3: Use the Provider

Wrap the relevant part of your application with the MyProvider component

```JSX
function App() {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      {/* Your components and UI */}
    </MyProvider>
  );
}

// example of the user auth
function App() {
  return (
    <UserProvider>
      <Home/>
    </UserProvider>
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Consume the Context

Inside any child component of MyProvider, you can use the `useContext hook` to access the shared data.

```JSX
function ChildComponent() {
  const data = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Data from context: {data.key}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// example with user auth
function ChildComponent() {
  const { setCurrentUser } = useContext(UserContext);

  const signOutHandler = async () => {
    setCurrentUser(null);
  };

  const signInHandler = async (event) => {
    setCurrentUser({ id: 1, user: "justin" });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Button value="signInButton" type="button" onClick={signInHandler} />
      <Button value="signOutButton" type="button" onClick={signOutHandler} />
    </div>
  );
}

```

## Step 5: Value Sharing

### MyContext example

The value prop provided to `MyContext.Provider` is the data that will be shared with all components wrapped by the `MyProvider component`. In this example, it's { key: 'value' }.

Now, any component using useContext(MyContext) will receive the updated data when updateData is called and those components will be re rendered.

### UserContext example or user auth

- The value prop provided to `MyContext.Provider` is the data that will be shared with all components wrapped by the `MyProvider component`.

- now all the children components can access the value "setCurrentUser" and "currentUser" properties

- if we are updating the the "currentUser" property using "setCurrentUser" method where every the `useContext(UserContext) hook` used those components will be re rendered again.

- That's a basic overview of how the Context API and the `useContext` hook work in React. It allows you to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level of the component tree.

## Overview

1. Import `React`, `createContext`, and `useState`.
2. Create a new context called `UserContext` with initial values for `setCurrentUser` and `currentUser`.
3. Create a `UserProvider` component that takes children as a prop. This component will be used to wrap parts of your application.
4. Inside `UserProvider`, we use the `useState` hook to create a `currentUser` state variable and a `setCurrentUser` function to update it.
5. Create a value object that contains the `currentUser` state and the `setCurrentUser` function.
6. Use `UserContext.Provider` to provide this value to any components that are children of `UserProvider`.

This setup allows you to use the UserContext and UserProvider in your application to manage and share the current user's data across components easily. When you call setCurrentUser within a component wrapped by UserProvider, it will update the `currentUser value` for all components using the `useContext(UserContext) hook.`

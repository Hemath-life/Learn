# Reducers,Actions,Dispatch and selectors

## reducers

- action modifier called reducer it's a object which includes key value pairs
- reducer receives actions what about th values

- `What it is:`
  - A reducer is like a decision-maker that decides how to change the application's data (state) based on the information it receives.
- `Example :`
  Think of a thermostat in your home. When it gets too hot, it reduces the temperature, and when it's too cold, it increases the temperature. The thermostat is like a reducer for your home's temperature.

## Actions

- Actions in Redux are plain JavaScript objects containing a type (describing the action) and optional data (payload) used to communicate and trigger state changes when dispatched to reducers.

- `What it is:`
  - An action is a message that tells the reducer what needs to be done. It's like a request or command.
- `Example:`
  - Imagine you have a remote control for your TV. Pressing buttons like "volume up" or "channel change" sends specific actions to the TV. Each action has a purpose and tells the TV what to do.

## Dispatch:

- `What it is:`
  - `Dispatch` is the act of sending an action to the reducer. It's like pressing a button to make something happen.
- `Example:`
  - When you press the "play" button on your music player, you're dispatching an action to start playing the song. The player, like a reducer, responds to your action.

`Reducer` is like the thermostat or TV that decides how to change the state (e.g., temperature or TV settings) based on incoming actions.

`Action` is like the commands you send to the reducer, specifying what you want to happen (e.g., increase temperature or change the TV channel).

`Dispatch` is the action-sending mechanism, like pressing buttons on a remote control or clicking a button in your app to trigger a specific action.

## Selectors:

`What they are:` Selectors are functions that act as a bridge between the `application's state` and `the components` that need specific data from that state.

`Purpose`: They provide a structured and efficient way to access and compute data from the state, often by filtering, sorting, or combining pieces of data.

`Example`: Imagine you have a list of products in your application's state, and you want to get the total price of all selected products in a shopping cart. You can create a selector function that takes the `state` as input, extracts the selected products, and computes the total price. This selector ensures that you always get an up-to-date total price without recomputing it every time.

# Reselect

**Problem:**

In Redux-based React applications, connected components often need to access and display data from the Redux store. However, when dealing with large or complex state trees, several issues can arise:

1. **Performance Overhead:** Extracting data directly from the Redux store in `mapStateToProps` functions can lead to performance issues. This is because `mapStateToProps` is called on every store update, potentially causing unnecessary re-renders of components even when the requested data hasn't changed.

2. **Data Extraction Complexity:** In some cases, components may require derived data or need to perform complex filtering and transformations on the state. Managing this complexity within `mapStateToProps` functions can make code harder to read and maintain.

3. **Lack of Reusability:** Extracting the same data in multiple components can lead to code duplication and reduced code reusability.

**Solution:**

Reselect provides a solution to these problems by introducing memoized selectors. Memoized selectors:

- Cache the results of data extraction functions, ensuring that expensive calculations are only performed when the input data changes.
- Improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-computation of derived data.
- Encourage the creation of modular and composable selectors, making code more readable and maintainable.
- Promote best practices by encouraging the separation of concerns related to data extraction from components.
- Enable selective data extraction, allowing components to efficiently access the specific data they need from the Redux store.

Overall, Reselect enhances the performance and maintainability of Redux-based React applications, particularly when dealing with large or complex state structures or when deriving data from the store.

```JSX

// Selects the categories slice from the Redux store.
const selectCategoriesReducer = (state) => state.categories;

/**
 * Creates a memoized selector function to efficiently retrieve categories data from the Redux store.
 *
 * @param {function} selectCategoriesReducer - A selector function that extracts the relevant slice of state from the Redux store.
 *
 * @returns {function} - A memoized selector function.
 *
 * @example
 * // Define a selector function to get categories data from the Redux store
 * const selectCategories = createSelector(
 *   (state) => state.categories, // selectCategoriesReducer
 *   (categoriesSlice) => categoriesSlice
 * );
 *
 * // Usage in a React component
 * const categories = useSelector(selectCategories);
 *
 * @description
 * The `createSelector` function is typically used in a Redux/React environment to create a memoized selector function. This selector function takes the current Redux state as input, extracts a specific slice of data from it (in this case, the categories slice), and returns that slice. Memoization ensures that the same output is returned for the same input, which can significantly improve performance in certain scenarios.
 *
 * This function helps to avoid unnecessary re-renders in React components by only recomputing the result if the input data (in this case, the categories slice of the Redux state) has changed. It's a common pattern for selecting and using data from a Redux store in a React application.

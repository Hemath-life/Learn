# Chapter 1: The ABCs of Javascript

## Problem ABCs solves

```js
const student = {
  name: "Rahul",
  showName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

student.showName(); //Rahul
```

Hence, 'this' used inside the function will refer to the student object. What if we assign the showName function to a global scoped variable greetStudent, and then call it as below...

```js
const student = {
  name: "Rahul",
  showName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

const greetStudent = student.showName;

greetStudent();
// undefined
//Does not print Anything
// 'this' refers to global object now
// because greetStudent is global, and hence student.showName is being called globally.
```

The reference to `'this' changes to the global object, & this can cause unwanted and hard to spot bugs`.

**To set `'this'`, we use the ABC of JavaScript.**

We can borrow or use the functionality of `showName method, without having to Make its copy keep separately for different objects`

This is known as **`Function Borrowing`**, used to efficiently utilize objects.

## call()

### Definition and Characteristics:

- The `call()` method is used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments rather than an array.

- The `call() method sets the reference to 'this' to the owner object`.

- **`It can be set to any value in the object which is being passed`**.
  (Arguments can be passed as well)

```js
const student = {
  name: "Rahul",
  showName: function (friend1, friend2) {
    console.log(this.name);
    console.log(friend1);
    console.log(friend2);
  },
};

student.showName.call({ name: "Rahul" }, "John", "Jane");
// Rahul
// John
// Jane
```

## apply()

### Definition and Characteristics:

- The `apply()` method in JavaScript is used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and an array (or array-like object) of arguments.

- apply() method is used like the **`same was as call()`**,

- **`accepts arguments in array form`**.

```js
const student = {
  name: "Rahul",
  showName: function (friend1, friend2) {
    console.log(this.name);
    console.log(friend1);
    console.log(friend2);
  },
};

student.showName.apply({ name: "Rahul" }, ["John", "Jane"]);
// Rahul
// John
// Jane
```

## bind()

### Definition and Characteristics:

- bind() method used in the `same way as to call()`, except that it **`returns a copy of the function`**,

- which can be invoked later. Even when greetStudent is globally scoped, the reference to 'this' is still set to the student object.

- Sometimes the bind() method has to be used to `prevent loosing this`.

```js
const student = {
  name: "Rahul",
  showName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

const greetStudent = student.showName.bind({
  name: "Rahul from Bind",
});

greetStudent(); // Rahul from Bind

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const member = {
  firstName: "Hege",
  lastName: "Nilsen",
};

let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
```

## Preserving this

Sometimes the bind() method has to be used to prevent loosing this.

In the following example, the person object has a display method. In the display method, this refers to the person object:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  display: function () {
    let x = document.getElementById("demo");
    x.innerHTML = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

person.display();
```

When a function is used as a callback, this is lost.

This example will try to display the person name after 3 seconds, but it will display undefined instead:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  display: function () {
    let x = document.getElementById("demo");
    x.innerHTML = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

setTimeout(person.display, 3000);
```

The bind() method solves this problem.

In the following example, the bind() method is used to bind person.display to person.

This example will display the person name after 3 seconds:

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  display: function () {
    let x = document.getElementById("demo");
    x.innerHTML = this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

let display = person.display.bind(person);
setTimeout(display, 3000);
```

## What is `this`?

- `this` is a special keyword in JavaScript.
- Its value is dynamically determined at runtime.
- In a function, `this` refers to the object that owns the function when invoked.
- In the global scope, `this` refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in a browser).
- For object methods, `this` points to the object that owns the method.
- In constructor functions, `this` refers to the newly created instance of the object.
- Explicitly set `this` using methods like `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`.
- Arrow functions inherit `this` from the enclosing scope, unlike regular functions.

## Sharing Methods:

- Objects in JavaScript can have methods (functions) as properties.
- Function borrowing allows one object to use a method from another object.

### Using `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`:

- Function borrowing is typically achieved using the `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()` methods.
- These methods allow you to invoke a function in a specific context, specifying the value of `this` inside the function.

### Dynamic Context:

Function borrowing allows for dynamic context, meaning you can use the same method on different objects.

### Reusability:

It promotes code reusability by allowing objects to share and reuse methods.

### Example using `call()`:

```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: "Object 1",
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log(`Hello from ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const obj2 = {
  name: "Object 2",
};

// Borrowing the sayHello method from obj1 for obj2 using call()
obj1.sayHello.call(obj2); // Outputs: Hello from Object 2
```

### Example using apply():

```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: "Object 1",
  sayHello: function (greeting) {
    console.log(`${greeting} from ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const obj2 = {
  name: "Object 2",
};

// Borrowing the sayHello method from obj1 for obj2 using apply()
obj1.sayHello.apply(obj2, ["Hola"]); // Outputs: Hola from Object 2
```

### Example using bind():

```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: "Object 1",
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log(`Hello from ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const obj2 = {
  name: "Object 2",
};

// Borrowing the sayHello method from obj1 for obj2 using bind()
const sayHelloForObj2 = obj1.sayHello.bind(obj2);
sayHelloForObj2(); // Outputs: Hello from Object 2
```

# Chapter 2: What is this?

## Introduction to `this` in JavaScript
In JavaScript, the `this` keyword is a reference to the current execution context. Understanding how `this` behaves in different situations is crucial for writing effective and bug-free code.

## Global Context
In the global context, outside of any function or object, `this` refers to the global object, which is `window` in a browser environment.


**Example:**
```javascript
console.log(this === window); // Output: true
```
## Function Context
Within a function, the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. It can be influenced by the way the function is called.

```javascript
function showContext() {
  console.log(this);
}

showContext(); // Output: Window object in a browser
```
## Constructor Context
When a function is used as a constructor with the new keyword, this refers to the newly created instance of the object.

Example:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice');
console.log(person1.name); // Output: Alice

```

## Event Listener Context
In event listeners, this typically refers to the element to which the listener is attached. However, this behavior can be affected by how the listener function is defined.


```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this); // Output: the button element
});
```


## `this` with Arrow Function

Inside a regular function, `this` keyword refers to the function where it is called.

However, `this` is not associated with arrow functions. Arrow function does not have its `own this`. So whenever you call this, it `refers to its parent scope`. For example,

Inside a regular function

```js
function Person() {
  this.name = "Jack",
    this.age = 25,
    this.sayName = function () {
      // this is accessible
      console.log(this.age);

      function innerFunc() {
        // this refers to the global object
        console.log(this.age);
        console.log(this);
      }

      innerFunc();
    };
}

let x = new Person();
x.sayName();

// output:
// 25
// undefined
// Window {}
```

Inside an arrow function

```js
function Person() {
  (this.name = "Jack"),
    (this.age = 25),
    (this.sayName = function () {
      console.log(this.age);
      let innerFunc = () => {
        console.log(this.age);
        // Here, the innerFunc() function is defined using the arrow function. And inside the arrow function, this refers to the parent's scope. Hence, this.age gives 25.
      };

      innerFunc();
    });
}

const x = new Person();
x.sayName();

// output:
// 25
// 25
```


## Explicitly Setting this
Developers can explicitly set the value of this using methods like `call`, `apply`, or `bind`. This allows control over the context in which a function is executed.

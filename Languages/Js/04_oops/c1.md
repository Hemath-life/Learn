# Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is Object-oriented Programming?

- Object-oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm or style centered around objects rather than functions.

### Note

- OOP is not a programming language or tool.

## 4 Pillars of OOPS

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## What is an Object?

- Objects contain related properties and methods.
- Variables are properties, and functions are methods.

### Example: Car Object

```javascript
Car is an object:
  Properties:
    - name
    - model
    - color
  Methods:
    - start()
    - stop()
    - brake()
    - move()
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves bundling related properties and methods in an object.
It refers to the practice of combining data with the methods that operate on that data.

### Procedure-based Approach

```js
let base_salary = 30_000;
let overTime = 10;
let rate = 20;

let getWage = function (base_salary, overTime, rate) {
  return base_salary + overTime * rate;
};
// Related data not available
```

### Encapsulation Approach

```js
let employee = {
  base_salary: 30_000,
  overTime: 10,
  rate: 20,
  getWage: function () {
    return this.base_salary + this.overTime * this.rate;
  },
};
employee.getWage();
// Every data available inside the object only
```

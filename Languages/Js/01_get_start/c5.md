# Chapter 5: Functions and methods

## Function Basics:

### Function Declaration:

This is a standard way of declaring a function with the `function` keyword.

```Javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Function Expression and Named Function Expression::

Assigning a function to a variable. This can be anonymous or have a name.

Similar to a regular function expression, but with a name for better stack traces.

```javascript
var add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

var add = function hello(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

#### Arrow Function (ES6+):

A concise way to write functions introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const add = (a) => a + 2;
const add = (a) => a + 2;

const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):

A function that is executed immediately after it's created.

```js
(function () {
  // Code here
})();
```

#### Generator Function (ES6+):

A special kind of function that can be paused and resumed.

```javascript
function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}
```

#### Constructor Function:

Functions that are used with the new keyword to create instances of objects.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```

#### Dynamic Function Names (ES6+):

```js
const functionName = "sayHello";
const obj = {
  [functionName](name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  },
};
```

#### Function in an Object Property (ES6+):

```js
const obj = {
  greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  },
};

const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name + "!");
  },
};
```

#### Function Constructor:

```js
const greet = new Function("name", 'console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");');
```

## Scope and Closures:

### **Global vs. Local Scope:**

- Global scope refers to variables that are accessible throughout the entire program.
- Local scope pertains to variables that are only accessible within a specific block or function.

### **Closure Concept:**

- A closure is formed when a function is defined within another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables.
- Closures provide a way to create private variables and encapsulate functionality within a limited scope.

## Function Context:

### `this` Keyword:

- The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the execution context of a function.
- It allows functions to access and manipulate the object it is called on.

### Functions as Methods:

- In JavaScript, functions can be assigned as properties of objects, becoming methods.
- Methods are functions that are associated with and can be called on objects.

## Callback Functions:

### Definition and Usage:

- Function passed as an argument to another function.
- Invoked within the higher-order function.

### Asynchronous Operations:

- Crucial for managing asynchronous tasks.
- Commonly used with functions like `setTimeout` and AJAX requests.

## Higher-Order Functions:

### Higher-Order Function Definition:

- Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
- Enables abstraction, code reusability, and functional programming concepts.

### Functions as First-Class Citizens:

- In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.
- They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

## Built-in Functions:

### Commonly Used Functions:

- Essential functions provided by the JavaScript language.
- Examples include `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, and `setTimeout`.

### String and Array Methods:

- JavaScript provides numerous methods for manipulating strings and arrays.
- Examples include `charAt`, `substring`, `indexOf` for strings, and `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for arrays.

## Recursion:

### Recursive Function Basics:

- A function that calls itself during its execution.
- Often used for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

### Pros and Cons:

- Pros include elegant solutions for certain problems and improved readability.
- Cons may involve performance issues for deep recursion and potential stack overflow.

## Writing Modular Functions:

-## Avoiding Side Effects:

- Strive for functions that produce predictable outputs without altering external state.
- Minimizing side effects improves code maintainability and makes functions more reusable and testable.

## ES6+ Features:

### Default Parameters:

- Allows setting default values for function parameters if no value or undefined is provided.

### Rest and Spread Operators:

- **Rest Operator (`...`):**
  - Gathers remaining arguments into an array.
- **Spread Operator (`...`):**
  - Spreads elements of an array or object into individual elements.

### Destructuring in Function Parameters:

- Enables extracting values from objects or arrays directly in function parameter declarations.

```javascript
// Default Parameters
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet(); // Output: Hello, Guest!
greet("John"); // Output: Hello, John!

// Rest and Spread Operators
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(sum(...numbers)); // Output: 15

// Destructuring in Function Parameters
function printUser({ name, age }) {
  console.log("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
}

const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
printUser(user); // Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

## Error Handling:

- **Using try, catch, finally:**

  - **try:** Contains the code where an error might occur.
  - **catch:** Handles the caught error and executes specified code.
  - **finally:** Contains code that will be executed regardless of whether an error occurred.

- **Throwing Custom Errors:**

  - Use the `throw` statement to create and throw custom errors.
  - Custom errors should typically extend the `Error` object.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Handle specific errors rather than catching all exceptions.
  - Provide meaningful error messages for debugging.
  - Use `finally` for cleanup operations.

# Chapter 1: Variables and Types of Declarations

## Variables

- ### Introduction to Variables

  Variables are containers for storing data values. In programming, a variable is a way to refer to a memory location that holds data. This data can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, or booleans.

- ### Naming Conventions
  When naming variables, it's essential to follow naming conventions for readability and maintainability. Typically, variables start with a letter, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. Choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.

## Data Types

- ### Primitive Data Types

  - #### String, Number, Boolean

    - **String**: Represents textual data. Example: `"Hello, World!"`
    - **Number**: Represents numeric values. Example: `42` or `3.14`
    - **Boolean**: Represents either `true` or `false`.

  - #### Null and Undefined
    - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Example: `null`
    - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. Example: `undefined`

- ### Complex Data Types
  - #### Object, Array, Function
    - **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs. Example: `{ name: "John", age: 30 }`
    - **Array**: An ordered list of values. Example: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - **Function**: A reusable block of code. Example:
      ```javascript
      function greet(name) {
        console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
      }
      ```

## 1.3 Declarations

- ### var, let, const

  - **var**: Used for variable declaration in older versions of JavaScript. It has function scope.
  - **let**: Introduces block-scoped variables in modern JavaScript.
  - **const**: Declares constants with block scope.

- ### Hoisting
  Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

## 1.4 Scope

- ### Global Scope

  Variables declared outside any function or block have a global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

- ### Local and Block Scope
  Variables declared inside a function or block have local or block scope, respectively. They are only accessible within that function or block.

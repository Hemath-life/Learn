### forEach , filter ,map ?

JavaScript has some handy methods which help us iterate through our arrays. The two most commonly used for iteration are Array.prototype.map() and Array.prototype.forEach().

Map:

- The map method receives a function as a parameter(in that function u can add two parameters one is value another one is index of the array)
- Then it applies it on each element and returns an entirely new array populated with the results of calling the provided function.
- The main difference between this two methods is that forEach allows you to change elements of original array and returns undefined and map does not allow you to change original array and intended for making new array based on original one.

forEach:

- .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.

\_ .map():

- .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
  \_ .filter():
- .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria(condition ) and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.

## Sub query ?

- We can write sub query inside SELECT,FROM AND WHERE
- ALL,ANY,SOME KEYWORD

## Where

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products
	WHERE price > (
   		SELECT avg(price) FROM products
   		)
ORDER BY id;

SELECT * FROM products
	WHERE price in (
  		SELECT price FROM products WHERE id IN (1,2,3,4,5,6)
  		)
ORDER BY id;

```

## ALL,ANY,SOME

THIS WILL WORK IN MYSQL and BOTH quarys ARE SAME

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
 	WHERE price > ALL(
 		SELECT * FROM products  WHERE brand ='vivo'
  );

 SELECT * FROM products
 	WHERE price >= (
 		SELECT MAX(price) FROM products  WHERE brand ='vivo'
  ) ORDER BY id;


 SELECT * FROM products
 	WHERE price > ANY (
 		SELECT price FROM products  WHERE brand ='vivo'
  );

 SELECT * FROM products
 	WHERE price > SOME (
 		SELECT price FROM products  WHERE brand ='vivo'
  );

```

## CORILATED SUB QUERY

```SQL
-- FINDING AVG OF ALL BRAND AND IF THE PRODUCTS PRICE > THEN OF ALL BRAND AVG THEN ONLY THE ROW WILL SELECT
 SELECT * FROM products
 WHERE price > ALL (
  	 SELECT AVG(price) FROM products GROUP BY brand
 );

-- for each employees
-- 	calculate the avg salary for employee.office
--     return the employee if salary > avg

-- for each function like here happen
 SELECT * FROM products p
 WHERE price >=  (
  	 SELECT AVG(price) FROM  products WHERE products.brand = p.brand
 );
```

## EXIST ,NOT EXIST OPERATOR

both are same

1.  1 is sub query return the true then that row will select - doesn't send result to parent query just return true or false
2.  2 one will time consume so use 1 for efficient - return the id to parent query

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products p
 WHERE EXISTS (
       SELECT id FROM products WHERE products.id = p.id
  );

SELECT * FROM products p
 WHERE id IN (
       SELECT DISTINCT id FROM products WHERE products.id = p.id
  ) order by id;


SELECT * FROM products p
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT id FROM products WHERE products.id = p.id
  );
```

## SUB Query IN SELECT STATEMENT

```SQL
  SELECT
  	price,brand,name,
    (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) AS price_avg,
    price-(SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) AS diff
 	    -- price-(SELECT price_avg) AS value
  FROM products;
```

## SUB Query IN FROM STATEMENT

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT
 	price,
    brand,
    name,
    (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) AS price_avg,
   price-(SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) AS diff
 FROM products) AS price_summaary
 	WHERE brand IS NOT NULL;

```

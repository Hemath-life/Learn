### Events ?

A task (or block of SQL code )
that `gets executed according to a schedule`

Events are very power full
example:

every at 10 am.

monthly onces.

```sql
-- my sql
show variables;
show variables like '%event%';
trun or event_schedule on mysql


-- psql
-- show the events
select * from pg_settings where name like '%event%'  ;


```

### Event Scheduler in PostgreSQL?

While a lot of people just use cron, the closest thing to a built-in scheduler is PgAgent. It's a component to the pgAdmin GUI management tool. A good intro to it can be found at Setting up PgAgent and doing scheduled backups.

## Transaction in SQL ?

will `club many SQL queries` into a group and you will execute all of them together as a part of a transaction.

### Properties of Transactions

Transactions have the following four standard properties, usually referred to by the acronym ACID.

**Atomicity** − ensures that all operations within the work unit are completed successfully. Otherwise, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure and all the previous operations are `rolled back to their former state`.

**Consistency** − ensures that the database properly changes states upon a successfully committed transaction.

**Isolation** − enables transactions to operate independently of and transparent to each other.

**Durability** − ensures that the result or effect of a committed transaction persists in case of a system failure

### Transaction Control

The following commands are used to control transactions.

**COMMIT** − to save the changes.

**ROLLBACK** − to roll back the changes.

**SAVEPOINT** − creates points within the groups of transactions in which to ROLLBACK.

**SET TRANSACTION** − Places a name on a transaction.

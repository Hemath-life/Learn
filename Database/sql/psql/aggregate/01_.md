## Aggregate Functions

`null values` wont count in aggregate function

```SQL
 SELECT
 MAX(price) as highest,
 MIN(price) as lowest,
 SUM(price) as total,
 COUNT(id) as number_of_product
 FROM products; -- give latest date in orders

- SELECT MAX(devliverd_at),MIN(devliverd_at) FROM orders;
```

## GROUP BY, HAVING AND WITH ROLLUP

PostgreSQL evaluates the HAVING condition after the
FROM,
WHERE,
GROUP BY,
HAVING,
SELECT,
DISTINCT,
ORDER BY,
LIMIT

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products;
SELECT
	MAX(price) AS highest,
    MIN(price) AS lowest,
    SUM(price) AS total,
    COUNT(id) AS no_product,
    brand
FROM products
WHERE brand IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand
-- 'WITH ROLLUP' FOR OTHER DBS NOT PSQL
-- Here column as part of select section only like lowest,total,no_product
-- HAVING no_product > 500; -- OR
-- HAVING MIN(price)>500
-- in ordet by either slect column names or group by name only can use
ORDER BY no_product DESC;

```

## Indexing

Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a `pointer to data in a table`. An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book.

An index helps to `speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses`; however, it `slows down data input, with UPDATE and INSERT statements`. Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data.

### For example

if you want to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, you have to first refer to the index, which lists all topics alphabetically and then refer to one or more specific page numbers.

### The CREATE INDEX Command
The basic syntax of CREATE INDEX is as follows âˆ’

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;
```

## Vector Search ?

PostgreSQL has two functions that do exactly what we intend to do:

- `to_tsvector` for creating a list of tokens (`the tsvector data type`, where `ts` stands for `"text search"`);

- `to_tsquery` for querying the `vector for occurrences of certain words or phrases`.

- For example: <br>
  To create a vector for the sentence '**the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog**' we can do the following:

- That's false because the search is smart enough not to match anything that simply starts with fox unless it's related to the same semantics (meaning) of the text originally vectorized; which is good because a fox (the animal) has little to do with foxtrot (the dance)!

- And finally, now with "jumping":

```SQL
SELECT to_tsvector('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.') @@ to_tsquery('jumping | dog');
```

## Operators and Uses

- tsquery also provides a `set of operators` that we would expect in any decent query facility.

- Operator
- AND operator (&):
- OR operator (|):
- NEGATION operator (!):
- proximity operator <->:
- SELECT to_tsvector('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.') @@ to_tsquery('jumping & dog & fox') ;
- SELECT to_tsvector('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.') @@ to_tsquery('hola | doging | foxing');
- SELECT to_tsvector('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.') @@ to_tsquery('!foxing');


```SQL
CREATE TABLE productvetor
(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY ,
    brand TEXT,
    model TEXT,
    spec TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    alltext TSVECTOR
);

INSERT INTO productvetor 
(brand,model,spec,description) 
VALUES
('apple','11 pro max','8gb ram ,128 gb rom ,water proof','top model in 2021'),
('apple','12 pro max','8gb ram ,256 gb rom ,phd display ,water proof','top model in 2022'),
('apple','13 pro max','8gb ram ,1tb gb rom ,qhd display,dolby sound, water proof,heart rate [bcrypt]
','top model in 2023');


-- -- View like create variable and storing the data after we want we can access like a table
SELECT * FROM productvetor;
CREATE VIEW product_view AS
SELECT
    id,
   (CONCAT(brand,model,spec,description)::TSVECTOR) as alldata
FROM productvetor ;

DROP VIEW product_view;

SELECT * FROM product_view WHERE alldata @@ to_tsquery('qhd | water');

```

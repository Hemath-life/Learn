## What we achieve in this project  
1. Create new accounts 
2. checks for proper privileges
3. reports if account creation fails

## whats is shell 
- shell script is  interpreted by operating system .
- lot of type shell 
    - bash - born again shell 
- to see system support shell - /etc/shells
- optional to add extension .sh
- #for comment 
- #! shebang or hashbang  


## What is shebang ?

`#!/bin/bash`
```
# = sharp
! = bang
#! = shebang

```
### Why we need this 
this will target the  bash for other os as well we don't know other user use bash or zshll so we target bash directly added to the path


## executes the hello world ?
1. create the .sh file 
``` sh 

#!/bin/bash

# Display 'Hello'
echo 'Hello'

```
2. insert the above given script
3. give the execute permission for the created file `chmod 755 filename`
5. ./filename in terminal


## echo and uptime 
- echo is build in 
- uptime is program
- `type -a echo` in terminal
    echo is a shell builtin
- `help echo ` so we can use
- `type -a uptime`
   show the how long system in logged in
- uptime is not shell builtin so we have use `man uptime` in terminal
- if shell build in use `type -a echo` else use `man program name` 

## variables
- sting or _ starts
- two type variables
    - system variables or predefine variables in capital
    - user define variables in lower case 
    - should not start with number


## single '' quotes vs double quotes " "
- single quotes prevents the interpret of the variables.    
- double quotes allow to interpret the variables. 

``` SH
name='how'

echo 'hi $name'
# OUTPUT : hi $name
echo "hi $name" 
# OUTPUT : hi how

# for string interpolation we should use dollars sing
echo "How are you ${name}."
# OUTPUT : How are you how

echo 'How are you ${name}'
# OUTPUT : How are you ${name}
```

## preset variables
- in linux we have preset variables like HOME,UID

``` SH
echo $HOME
echo $UID
```


## How to execute the comments inside the shell script
- $() and `` dose the same thing.
``` SH
# display the username
username=$(id -un) # or whoami

# or 
username=`id -un`
echo "Hi ${username}" 

```

## if else 
``` sh
if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]]
then 
    echo 'You are root'
else
    echo 'You are not root'
fi

# integer
# > greter then
# < less then
# <=
# >=
# ne not equal

# # sting
# = equal or -eq or assign depends on where we use 
# == equal - parrten matching will performs
# != not equal -ne
# < is less then ASCII alphabetic order
# > is greter then ASCII alphabetic order
# -z sting null or that as zero length


count=10
if  (( $count  > 9  ))
then
          echo "condition is true"
fi

count=10
if  (($count  < 5  ))
then
          echo "condition is true"
else
          echo "condition is false"
fi
```

## double bracket [[ or (())
- it is shell keyword
- [[ expression ]] or []
- (())
- [[ after space and ]] before space is import 
    `if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]]`


## error handling (exit)
- exit status determines the whether the program fails or succeed
- if the program or function returns exits as 0 then code ran successfully
- other then exit 0 code everything is meaning as error we can define exit code for error 1 to n numbers depends on our need


## special variables  
- ${?} - allows to give use last executed comments status or exit status

``` sh
#!/bin/bash

# display if the UID does NOT match 1000
UID_TO_TEST_FOR='1000';

if [[ "${UID}" -ne "${UID_TO_TEST_FOR}" ]];
then
    echo "Your UID does not match with: ${UID_TO_TEST_FOR}"
    exit 1;
fi

# display the username 
username=`id -un` # or whoami or $(id -un)
echo "Hi ${username}"

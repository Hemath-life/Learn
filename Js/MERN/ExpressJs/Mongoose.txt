1. Mongoose difference between Connect and Create connection ?
          _ when there is only one connection mongoose.connect() is use, whereas if there is multiple instance of connection mongoose.createConnection() is used.
          _ when you use createConnection you supposed to use assigned variable name.model while creating model otherwise you can use mongoose.model

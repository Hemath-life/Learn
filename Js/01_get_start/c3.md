## Block Scope:

### Definition and Concept:

Block scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables within a specific block of code. A block is defined by a pair of curly braces `{}`. Variables declared with `let` and `const` have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.

### Example:

```javascript
if (true) {
  let blockVariable = "I am inside a block!";
  console.log(blockVariable); // Outputs 'I am inside a block!'
}

console.log(blockVariable); // Throws an error: 'ReferenceError: blockVariable is not defined'
```

### Variables in Block Scope

#### let and const in Blocks:

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are limited to the `block` in which they are defined.
They are not hoisted to the top of the function.

#### Visibility and Access Rules:

Variables in block scope are not accessible outside the block.
The `temporal dead zone` applies to variables in block scope.

## Function Scope:

### Definition and Concept:

Function scope refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables within a specific function. Variables declared with `var` have function scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are defined.

### Example:

```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
  var functionVariable = "I am inside a function!";
  console.log(functionVariable); // Outputs 'I am inside a function!'
}

exampleFunction();

console.log(functionVariable); // Throws an error: 'ReferenceError: functionVariable is not defined'

// Declare and initialize a variable x with the value 1102 in the global scope
var x = 1102;

// Define a function named exampleVar
function exampleVar() {
  // Log the value of x before its declaration in the function scope
  console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined (due to hoisting)

  // Declare and initialize a new variable x with the value 10 in the function scope
  var x = 10;

  // Enter an if block
  if (true) {
    // Within the if block, redeclare the variable x with the value 20
    // Note: This re-declaration affects the outer scope due to var's function-scoping
    var x = 20;
    // Log the value of x within the if block
    console.log(x); // Outputs: 20
  }

  // Log the final value of x after the if block
  // The re-declaration within the if block affects this scope
  console.log(x); // Outputs: 20
}

// Call the exampleVar function
exampleVar();
```

### Variables in Function Scope

#### var in Functions:

Variables declared with var are accessible throughout the entire function.
They are hoisted to the top of the function.

#### Function Scope Behavior:

Variables in function scope can be re-declared using var.
The `temporal dead zone` does not apply to variables in function scope.

## Hosting

### Definition and Concept:

- Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where `variable` and `function` declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

It applies to both var, let, and const, but with differences in behavior.

### Hoisting with var, let, and const:

- `var` variables are hoisted and `initialized` with `undefined`.
- `let` and `const` variables are `hoisted` but `not initialized`.

## 3.4 Temporal dead zone

### Definition and Concept

The temporal dead zone is a phase during the execution of JavaScript code where a variable declared with `let` or `const` exists in the scope but is not yet initialized and cannot be accessed. This zone occurs from the start of the scope until the actual declaration of the variable.

## Purpose of the Temporal Dead Zone

The introduction of the temporal dead zone was to address issues associated with hoisting in JavaScript. It ensures that variables declared with `let and const are not accessed before their declaration`, `promoting more predictable and error-free code`. This behavior encourages developers to declare variables before using them and avoids potential bugs.

## Example

```javascript
console.log(x); // Error: 'ReferenceError'
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // Outputs '10'
```

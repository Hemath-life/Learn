# Things You Should Avoid With Arrow Functions

You should not use arrow functions to create methods inside objects.

```js
let person = {
  name: "Jack",
  age: 25,
  sayName: () => {
    // this refers to the global .....
    //
    console.log(this.age);
  },
};

person.sayName();
// undefined
```

You cannot use an arrow function as a constructor

```js
let Foo = () => {};
let foo = new Foo(); // TypeError: Foo is not a constructor
```

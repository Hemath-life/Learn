## What is SASS?

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to write CSS code in a more efficient and organized way. It provides features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions, which can help simplify and streamline your CSS code.

## How to set up SASS in a React project

To set up SASS in a React project, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `sass` package by running the following command in your project directory:

```BASH
npm install sass
```

2. Rename your CSS files to have a `.scss` extension instead of `.css`.
3. Import your `.scss` files in your JavaScript files using the `import` statement.
4. Start using SASS features in your `.scss` files, such as variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.

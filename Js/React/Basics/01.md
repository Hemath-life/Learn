# Before React

- Traditionally we have html, javascript,css it contains the Jquery
- JS use improved to renders the dom element in single page then React Js,angular came
- Angular came 2010 comes with MVC pattern
- React came 2013
- organization the code and manipulate the content of the page

# Declarative vs Imperative

**React Concepts**

1. "Don't touch the DOM, I'll do it."
2. "I'll manipulate the DOM."
3. React introduces reusable components resembling building blocks in mobile applications:
   - The application comprises small, reusable components.
4. Components-based architecture.
5. React acts as a foundational library, providing an architecture for rendering code with components, facilitating integration with other libraries and npm packages.
6. This architecture serves as a blueprint for structuring applications.

**React Flow:**

- Data (State) -> Component -> Added to App
- State (JS Object) -> Component -> React Library leverages the state object and component to generate the **Virtual DOM**, a JavaScript representation of the real DOM.
- (State + Component) -> Combined using JSX.

### Data Flow in React - One-Way Data Flow (Steps 1 to 6)

1. When someone modifies the state (State Change Trigger),
2. The state object is updated first.
3. The component is re-rendered.
4. Changes are applied to the Virtual DOM.
5. The Virtual DOM is compared to the Original DOM.
6. Specific changes are identified and applied as necessary updates.

### Declarative Approach

1. "Don't touch the DOM, I will manage the complexity of DOM manipulation."
2. Modifying the DOM is a complex and costly operation. React simplifies this complexity.
3. Declare the state and changes; React understands the subsequent steps through instructions in the React code.
4. React functions as a comprehensive JavaScript object.

### Descriptive Focus:

- Declarative approach in React emphasizes describing the desired UI state.
- Automatic Handling: React manages efficient updates and rendering, abstracting manual DOM manipulation for improved development.

### Imperative Approach

1. Directly modify specific parts of the application.
   - Manually manipulate the DOM using jQuery and JavaScript.

# npm and npx

## npx(Node Package eXecute)

- It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it.
- NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2. 0 and above

## npm (Node Package Manager)

- managers all the dependencies in the project
- npm is the install and then execution commend

**Difference between NPM vs NPX**

- NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine.
- NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.

# React Setup

## React Developer tool chrome extension

- Allow to see the components of the React App.
- `npx create-react-app appName`

## File Structure of the React Js

Package.json

- give the current project information
- dependency's of the project

package.lock.json

- ensures the project in future also use same versions dependency when the project dependency used while created

### serviceWorkers file

- allows to work react work offline

---

## Babel and Webpack

**Babel:**

1. Transpiles modern JavaScript to older versions for browser compatibility.
2. Uses presets and plugins to apply necessary code transformations.
3. Ensures cross-browser support by converting advanced syntax.

**Webpack:**

1. Bundles assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images into optimized packages.
2. Employs loaders to process diverse file types during bundling.
3. Optimizes, minifies, and generates cache-friendly files for deployment.

# React Component

Component all about telling about `when you want to render and re-render the component`

### Functional Based Component

React component Name always starts with with `Capital` letter.

```jsx
import React from "react";

function FunctionalComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, I'm a Functional Component!</h1>
      <p>This is a minimal example of a functional React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FunctionalComponent;
```

### Class Based Component

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class MinimalClassComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, I'm a Class Component!</h1>
        <p>This is a minimal example of a class-based React component.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MinimalClassComponent;
```

## React Key

- **Efficient List Rendering**: The `key` prop optimizes rendering and updates for lists.
- **Update Optimization**: Proper `key` values enable targeted updates, avoiding full list re-renders.
- **Preserving Component Identity**: Unique `key` values maintain component identity, preventing issues.
- **Avoiding Reordering Issues**: The `key` prevents incorrect item reordering during updates.
- **Array Index as Key**: Avoid using the array index as `key` due to rendering and performance pitfalls.
- **Stable Component Instances**: Consistent `key` values help manage component instances and state.
- **Best Practices**: Use unique and stable IDs as `key` values for proper functioning.
- **Performance Boost**: Correct `key` usage enhances performance and the user experience.

# Jsx (Javascript xml)

- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax that allows you to write HTML and JavaScript (CSS as well) in a single format. It was introduced by Facebook for use in React.

- **HTML-like Code**: JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript expressions.

- **Babel Plugin**: To convert JSX to JavaScript, you need a small Babel plugin or module.

- **Example JSX Code**:

```JSX

// step 1
let elements = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello React</h1>
  </div>
);

//  above elements is not HTML elements those look like html but those are below objects
//  babel convert those elements to objects  like below

console.log(elements);

// step 2
// output:
{
    "type": "div",
    "key": null,
    "ref": null,
    "props": {
        "children": {
            "type": "h1",
            "key": null,
            "ref": null,
            "props": {
                "children": "Hello React"
            },
            "_owner": null,
            "_store": {}
        }
    },
    "_owner": null,
    "_store": {}
}

// step 3:
react.createElement(elements);

```

## React app with Jsx

```jsx
//  APP with JSX
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React</h1>
      <button>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// React app with out JSX
function App() {
  return React.createElement("div", null, [
    React.createElement("h1", { style: { color: "red" } }, "Hello React"),
    React.createElement("button", null, "Submit"),
  ]);
}
```

## JSX in React: Key Points

- **JSX Basics:**

  - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, used in React to describe UI.
  - Allows HTML-like code within JavaScript.
  - Recommended for defining React components.

- **Embedding Expressions:**

  - Embed JavaScript expressions using curly braces `{}`.
  - Example: `<p>{2 + 2}</p>` becomes `<p>4</p>`.

- **Components in JSX:**

  - Use custom React components like HTML elements.
  - Example: `<MyComponent />` renders `MyComponent`.

- **Attributes:**

  - Use HTML-like attributes to set props.
  - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />`.

- **Class vs ClassName:**

  - Use `className` for CSS classes.
  - Example: `<div className="container">...</div>`.

- **Self-Closing Tags:**

  - Use self-closing tags for elements without children.
  - Example: `<input type="text" />`.

- **JSX Comments:**

  - Use `{/* */}` for comments within JSX.
  - Example: `{/* This is a comment */}`.

- **Conditional Rendering:**

  - Use conditional expressions for dynamic rendering.
  - Example: `{isAuth ? <User /> : <Guest />}`.

- **Mapping Lists:**

  - Use `map` to render lists dynamically.
  - Example: `{items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}`.

- **Styling:**

  - Define inline styles as JavaScript objects.
  - Example: `<div style={{ color: 'blue', fontSize: '16px' }}>Styled Text</div>`.

- **Fragments:**

  - Use `<>...</>` to group elements without a wrapper.
  - Useful to avoid extra `<div>` layers.

- **Dangerous HTML:**

  - Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with caution for raw HTML.

- **Props and Children:**
  - Pass props and render child components within JSX.

Remember to transpile JSX with tools like Babel before using in browsers. It's a powerful way to write expressive React code resembling HTML.

# State

## State Types in React

State is a fundamental concept in React that allows components to store and manage data that can change over time. There are two main types of state:

## 1. Local State (Inside the Component)

Local state refers to the state that is managed and stored within an individual React component.

It is used to store component-specific data that doesn't need to be shared with other components.

Local state is managed using the `useState` hook in functional components or the `setState` method in class components.

### Local State Characteristics:

- **Isolation:** Each component manages its own local state independently.
- **Component-specific:** Data stored in local state is private to the component.
- **Use Cases:** Storing UI-related data, form inputs, toggles, etc.

## 2. Global State (Redux and Other State Management Libraries)

Global state refers to the state that is shared across multiple components and can be accessed from anywhere in the application.

Redux is a popular state management library for managing global state, but there are other libraries available as well.

### Global State Characteristics:

- **Centralized:** State is stored in a central store accessible to all components.
- **Cross-Component Sharing:** Multiple components can read and update the same state.
- **Use Cases:** Managing app-wide data, user authentication, complex state interactions.

## Comparison:

| Aspect         | Local State          | Global State (Redux)    |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Scope          | Limited to Component | Application-wide        |
| Data Isolation | Isolated             | Shared                  |
| Communication  | Not easily shared    | Shared and accessible   |
| Complexity     | Simple               | Can be more complex     |
| Setup Overhead | Minimal              | Setup and Configuration |
| Use Cases      | UI-related data      | App-wide state          |

In most cases, using local state is sufficient for managing component-specific data, while global state is suitable for managing data that needs to be accessed and modified across different parts of the application.

Remember that the choice between local and global state depends on the complexity and scale of your application.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
  // Constructor to initialize the component's state
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Initialize state with a property called 'count'
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  // Function to increment the count in state
  incrementCount = () => {
    // Use setState to update the state
    // making the component to re render update the UI
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  // Function to decrement the count in state
  decrementCount = () => {
    // Use setState to update the state
    // making the component to re render update the UI
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });

    console.log(this.state);
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Display the count from state */}
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        {/* Buttons to trigger state updates */}
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrementCount}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [renderCount, setRenderCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  // useEffect to update the render count whenever the component re-renders
  useEffect(() => {
    setRenderCount(renderCount + 1);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <p>Component has re-rendered {renderCount} times.</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrementCount}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## Re-render

### Object References and React Re-rendering

In JavaScript and React, understanding object references is crucial to comprehend how re-rendering works. Let's explore an example:

```js
const obj1 = { age: 10 };
const obj2 = obj1;

obj1.age = 20;
```

In this code snippet:

- An object obj1 is created with the age property set to 10.
- Another variable obj2 is assigned the reference of obj1, making both obj1 and obj2 point to the same object in memory.
- The age property of obj1 is updated to 20.

in this scenario, the reference to the object didn't change. Only the property value within the object was updated. Consequently, React won't trigger a re-render when you modify obj1 or obj2 this way, as the reference remains unchanged.

For `React to detect a change and trigger a re-render`, it requires a change in reference. This typically happens when you create a new object with updated properties or when you use functional updates for state changes.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
  // Constructor to initialize the component's state
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Initialize state with a property called 'count'
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  // Function to increment the count in state
  incrementCount = () => {
    // Use setState to update the state and create the new reference
    // making the component to re render update the UI
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  // Function to decrement the count in state
  decrementCount = () => {
    // Use setState to update the state and create the new reference
    // making the component to re render update the UI
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Display the count from state */}
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        {/* Buttons to trigger state updates */}
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrementCount}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

### How `setState` Works in React's Class Components

React's `setState` function in class components is a key mechanism for updating and managing component state. It works by creating a new object with a new reference, which enables React to efficiently detect changes and trigger re-renders.

setState(async function) works as `asynchronous` way

```jsx
// Function to decrement the count in state
decrementCount = () => {
  // Use setState to update the state
  // making the component to re render update the UI
  this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 });

  // This will print old state values cox of the setState asynchronous way
  console.log(this.state);

  // Another way to increment the count very Standard way

  // to resolve this issue
  // take two arguments as functions update function ,callback function once the state is updated call callback function execute.
  // this.setState(
  //   (state) => {
  //     count: state.count - 1;
  //   },
  //   () => {
  //     console.log(this.state);
  //   }
  // );
};
```

Here's a breakdown of how `setState` works:

1. **Immutable Update:**

   - When you call `setState`, React creates a new object that represents the updated state.
   - This new object is constructed based on the current state but with the specific changes you provide.

2. **New Object Reference:**

   - The new object created by `setState` has a different reference from the previous state object.
   - This change in reference is crucial for React to identify that the state has been updated.

3. **Shallow Comparison:**

   - When React performs a re-render, it conducts a shallow comparison between the previous state and the new state.
   - This comparison involves checking the references of the state object's properties.

4. **Re-Render:**
   - If React detects that the state references have changed, it knows that the state has been updated.
   - React then triggers a re-render of the component, updating the rendered output to reflect the new state.
   - Only the parts of the component affected by the state change will be re-rendered, optimizing performance.

This approach of creating a new object with a new reference and using shallow comparisons allows React to efficiently track state changes and update the UI without unnecessary re-renders.

Please note that while this explanation is centered around class components, the concept of creating new references to update state is also employed in functional components using the `useState` hook.

### Updating Primitive State in Function-Based Components

In React function-based components, the concept of creating new references to update state applies to primitive values such as booleans, numbers, and strings. Here's how it works:

1. **State Initialization:**

   - When you initialize state using the `useState` hook with a primitive value, the state holds the initial value provided.

2. **State Update:**

   - When you update the state using the setter function provided by `useState`, you create a new value with a new reference.
   - This new value represents the updated state and is distinct from the previous state.

3. **Re-Rendering:**

   - React detects the change in state value reference and triggers a re-render of the component.
   - A shallow comparison between the previous state value and the new state value determines if a re-render is necessary.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - React's re-rendering mechanism optimizes performance by selectively updating only the component parts affected by state changes.

Here's a practical example using a boolean state in a function-based component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(true);

  const toggle = () => {
    // Update the state with a new boolean value and new reference
    setIsOn(!isOn);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggle}>{isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Shallow Merging

Shallow merging is a process in programming where the top-level properties of two or more objects are combined, overwriting properties from the latter objects onto the earlier ones.

However, it does not deeply merge nested objects; instead, it replaces entire nested objects with those from later objects.

Shallow merging is useful when updating specific properties at the top level while keeping others unchanged.

**Key Points:**

1. **Top-Level Properties:**
   Shallow merging combines the top-level properties of two or more objects, overwriting properties from the latter objects onto the earlier ones.

2. **Nested Objects:**
   Shallow merging does not deeply merge nested objects. Instead, it replaces the entire nested object with the one from the later object.

3. **Use Cases:**
   Shallow merging is useful when you want to update specific properties at the top level while keeping others unchanged.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  address: { city: "New York", country: "USA" },
};
const obj2 = { age: 30, address: { city: "San Francisco" } };

const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };

console.log(mergedObject);
// output:
// { name: 'John', age: 30, address: { city: 'San Francisco' } }
```

# Need to Know

## 1. Double Render

1. **Double Render on State Change:**
   - When you change the state of a React component, it can result in a double render of that component.
2. **Console Log Colors:**

   - The console logs that appear in `white` are your application's output, representing the actual rendering and behavior of your components.
   - The console logs that appear in `gray` are related to React Strict Mode, and they are intended to help identify potential issues during development.

3. **React Developer Extension:**

   - To better understand and debug React components, it's recommended to install the React Developer Tools extension for your browser.

4. **React Strict Mode:**
   - Wrapping your `<App />` component with `<React.StrictMode>` as shown ensures that you receive warnings and potential issue notifications related to your application's behavior during development.

# useState

The `useState` hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to manage and update their own state.

It provides a way to declare state variables and a function to update them within a functional component.

### Syntax:

```jsx
const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);
```

`stateVariable`: This is the variable that holds the current state value.

`setStateFunction`: This is a function that you can use to update the state.

`initialValue`: The initial value you want to assign to the state variable.

### Example

Suppose you want to create a simple counter component using `useState`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // Define a state variable 'count' with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Event handler to increment the count
  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

# useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is a fundamental part of React's functional component API.

It allows you to perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscription management.

This hook is often used to handle tasks that involve interactions with the outside world or managing component lifecycle events.

### Syntax:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

useEffect(() => {
  // Your code for side effects goes here
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

The first argument to `useEffect` is a function containing the code for your side effect.

The second argument is an optional array of dependencies. If provided, the effect will only run if any of the dependencies have changed since the last render.

### Common Use Cases

**Data Fetching:** You can use useEffect to fetch data from APIs or other data sources when the component mounts.

**DOM Manipulation:** You can perform DOM manipulations, like adding event listeners or updating the DOM, within useEffect.

**Subscriptions:** When dealing with real-time data from WebSocket connections or other event sources, you can use useEffect to set up and tear down subscriptions.

**Clean-up:** useEffect also allows you to return a cleanup function, which will be executed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change. This is useful for tasks like unsubscribing from event listeners or cancelling network requests.

### Example

Here's a simple example of using `useEffect` to fetch data when a component mounts:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return <div>{data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}</div>;
}
```

## Timing of `useEffect` Execution in React

The `useEffect` hook in React runs at specific times during a component's lifecycle. The timing of its execution depends on whether you specify a dependency array and what values are included in that array:

### 1. Without Dependencies (Empty Dependency Array)

If you pass an empty dependency array (`[]`) as the second argument to `useEffect`, it will run the effect only once after the initial render of the component. This is similar to the behavior of `componentDidMount` in class components. It won't run again for subsequent re-renders.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs once after the initial render
}, []);
```

### 2. With Dependencies

When you provide a non-empty array of dependencies, the effect will run whenever any of the dependencies change. This is similar to the behavior of componentDidUpdate in class components.

```jsx
const someValue = /* some value */;

useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs whenever 'someValue' changes
}, [someValue]);
// If multiple dependencies are specified, the effect will run if any of them change.
```

### 3. Without Dependencies (No Dependency Array)

If you omit the second argument altogether, the effect will run after every render.

This can lead to performance issues and should be used with caution. It is similar to the behavior of componentDidUpdate without specifying conditions.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs after every render
});
```

### 4. Cleanup Function

In all cases, if your `useEffect` function returns a function, it will act as a `cleanup` function.

This cleanup function is executed when the component `unmounts` or when the dependencies change (before the effect runs again). It's used to clean up any resources, subscriptions, or event listeners created by the effect.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // This effect runs (and cleanup runs) when the component mounts and unmounts
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code goes here
  };
}, []);
```

## Why is it Called `useEffect`?

The `useEffect` hook in React is named "useEffect" because it is designed to manage and execute side effects in functional components.

`Side effects` are operations that occur outside of the normal component rendering process and can include tasks like data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions to external data sources.

The name "useEffect" signifies its usage as a hook specifically created for managing side effects within React components. It follows the naming convention of other React hooks, such as `useState` and `useContext`, which also clearly describe their intended purposes.

In summary, "useEffect" is called as such because it is used to efficiently manage and handle side effects in a declarative manner within functional components in React.

# useContext

First, you need to import the useContext hook from React. Here's how you do it:

```JSX
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
```

Next, you need to create a context using the createContext function. This context will hold the shared data that you want to access in your components. Here's an example:

```JSX
const MyContext = React.createContext();
```
